"""Clean-room SEAL (Steerable rEAsoning caLibration) for LatentMAS.

Reference: "SEAL: Steerable Reasoning Calibration of Large Language Models for
Free", Chen et al., arXiv:2504.07986.

This package implements a training-free steering-vector intervention whose
primary objective here is *token efficiency*: suppress redundant reflection /
transition thoughts during the LatentMAS Judger's text decoding so it produces
shorter reasoning traces while retaining accuracy.

Components:
  - thought_classifier: heuristic execution / reflection / transition labeler
  - vector_generation:  build the steering vector from labeled hidden states
  - extraction:         offline pipeline that produces the steering vector
  - hooks:              on-the-fly residual-stream intervention during decoding
